# ~/mbillow/.dotfiles

A simple repo with all of the things that make me feel at home.

# Installation

Unless you are me, which you probably aren't, don't just blindly install this.

```
curl -L https://github.com/mbillow/dotfiles/archive/primary.zip -output dotfiles.zip
unzip dotfiles.zip 'dotfiles-primary' .dotfiles && rm dotfiles.zip
source .dotfiles/boostrap.sh
```

# Special Thanks

I used [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) as a springboard
for `bootstrap.sh`.
